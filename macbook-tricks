Setting Up Terminal Access for Atom
One of the things you’ll do frequently is open an entire folder (like when working on a project) in your text editor. Let’s get that setup:

Open Atom (command-spacebar for spotlight, type Atom, and hit enter).
Click the Atom menu in the top left corner
Click Install Shell Commands
Return to your terminal and enter which atom. You should get back /usr/local/bin/atom
Enter atom . to open your user directory in Atom.
Experiment with creating a file in Atom and using ls in the terminal to see it. Try creating a file in the terminal with touch and see if it shows up in Atom.
